## Stack

- They are data structure LIFO type `Last-In-First-Out`, where the last element to be inserted will be the first to be retired. So a stack allows access to one item of data the last inserted.

<a id="queue"></a>
## Queue

- Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows `First-In-First-Out` methodology.

<a id="deck"></a>
## Deck

- Deck is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contrasted on both ends.

## Linked List

- A linked list or a current list is a dynamic, linear data structure. It is composed of several cells that are interconnected through pointers, that is, each cell has a pointer that points to the memory address of the next cell.
