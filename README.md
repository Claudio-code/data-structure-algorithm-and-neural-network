## Stack

- They are data structure LIFO type `Last-In-First-Out`, where the last element to be inserted will be the first to be retired. So a stack allows access to one item of data the last inserted.

<a id="queue"></a>
## Queue

- Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows `First-In-First-Out` methodology.
