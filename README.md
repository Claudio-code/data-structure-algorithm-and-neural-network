<a id="stack"></a>
## Stack

- They are data structure LIFO type `Last-In-First-Out`, where the last element to be inserted will be the first to be retired. So a stack allows access to one item of data the last inserted. 

<hr>

<a id="queue"></a>
## Queue

- Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows `First-In-First-Out` methodology. 

<hr>

<a id="deck"></a>
## Deck

- Deck is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contrasted on both ends.

<hr>

<a id="linked-list"></a>
## Linked List

- A linked list or a current list is a dynamic, linear data structure. It is composed of several cells that are interconnected through pointers, that is, each cell has a pointer that points to the memory address of the next cell.

<hr>

<a id="binary-tree"></a>
## Binary tree

- Is a data structure by: Or has no element. Or it has a distinct element, called the root, with two pointers to two different structures, called the left subtree and right subtree.

<hr>

<a id="priority-queue"></a>
## Priority queue

- It is a queue where each element has a priority. This priority determines the position of an element in the queue, so it determines who should be removed from the queue first.

<hr>

<a id="binary-heap"></a>
## Binary Heap

- The binary Heap is binary three complete or almost.
- Have a Min-heap e Max-heap.
  - Min-heap:
    - The value of each node is greater than or equal to its parent's value, the lowest value is in the root.
  - Max-heap:
    - The value of each node is lowest than or equal to its parent's value, the greater value is in the root.
  - The elements are arranged in heap so that the father always has greater or equal priority than their children's priority.
